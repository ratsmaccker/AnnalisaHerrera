    <h3>Rating: 10/10</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about">Ea.com</a> says, "Embark on the craziest journey of your life in It Takes Two, a genre-bending platform adventure created purely for co-op. Play as the clashing couple Cody and May, two humans turned into dolls by a magic spell. Trapped in a fantastical world, they’re reluctantly challenged with saving their fractured relationship by the suave love guru Dr. Hakim. A huge variety of gleefully disruptive gameplay challenges stand between them and their return to normal."<p>

    <p>This game is filled with action-adventure, puzzles, and teamwork. I have played this game many times with different friends. I remember my first time playing and want to share it with my friends! I have them figure out the different puzzles on their own because the game would likely not be fun if someone told them what to do throughout the game. This is my most played game. I have over 100 hours in it.</p>

      <h3>Rating: 8/10</h3>
      <p>This game is a singleplayer top-down shooter. It requires stealth and environmental awareness. According to  <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hotline-miami/">Allistair Pinsof</a>, "[t]he quicker you take down a room of enemies, the more likely you are to move on to the next. Knocking an enemy down by slamming the door, grabbing a melee weapon, and pummeling him while he is on the ground are regular acts of aggression in Hotline. There are plenty of guns, but firing one will summon most enemies in a level — and they have plenty of guns, too. In some cases, you’ll need to go in guns-blazing but it’s not always the most effective approach.<p>
  
      <p>I rated this game an 8/10 because the gameplay is amazing. However, the storyline can be a bit difficult to follow at times. I have about 30 hours in this game.</p>

        <h3>Rating: 9/10</h3>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/30729/Portal+2/">esrb.com</a>, "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Chell, a human who is trapped in a scientific testing facility. From a first-person perspective, players solve numerous physical puzzles as they navigate through post-apocalyptic environments. Players use a 'portal gun' to open transportation gateways. Throughout the game, players must avoid hazards such as stationary gun turrets, toxic substances, poisonous gas, and giant pistons; some sequences are accompanied by realistic gunfire. Robot droids can also be destroyed; for example, in one boss battle, players must defeat a robot by throwing small bombs. The words 'damn' and 'hell' can be heard in the dialogue."<p>
    
        <p>This game is filled with puzzles and teamwork. I have also played this game many times with different friends! There are many things to do in this game. There is the campaign, the co-op gameplay, and many community made test chambers that are fun for friends to go through. I have rated this a 9/10 because the community test chambers. Many of them are very similar and can get tedious rather quickly. I have about 40 hours in this game.</p>

        <h3>Rating: 7/10</h3>
        <p>ARMA 3 is an open-world, realism-based, military tactical shooter video game. There are many different vehicles and guns to use. Available to play is the campaign as well as co-op. There are different game modes for players to choose from.<p>
    
        <p>This game is rated a 7/10 mainly because I do not typically play this sort of game. This game is the type of game people like to play with their friends, so if you don't have friends who do not play this game, it may be harder to get into. I've heard from friends that have been in the military that this game is "too realistic". I have an ex-military friend who refuses to play this game for that. I have about 60 hours in this game.</p>

    <h3>Rating: 10/10</h3>
    <p>Left 4 Dead 2 is a first person shooter. Each story has an objective. The objective of the game is to survive through an apocalypse. There are the normal infected as well as "specials". The specials include boomers, hunters, smokers, jockeys, chargers, spitters, and tanks. Boomers vomit a special bile at players, which makes their vision blurry and draws a horde of common infected to them. Hunters are extremely fast. If a hunter pounces on a survivor, he will claw through a survivor until the survivor is dead or the hunter is killed by another teammate. These are just a few exampoles of these special infected. The other specials have different abilities. 
      
      There are many game modes to choose from, such as survival and versus. The <p>

    <p>This game is one of my favorites. I enjoy playing this game with friends, especially friends who have not played this game in many years. I have started to speedrun this game because I have noticed that it can be in your best interest to go faster. The longer you stay in an area, the more likely it is that a horde or mroe specials will attack and try to kill you.</p>
